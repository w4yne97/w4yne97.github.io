## Hobbies & Interests

When I'm not debugging code or reading papers, here's what I enjoy doing.

### 🏸 Badminton

Big fan of badminton! I try to hit the court 1-2 times a week — it keeps me sane after long hours of research. Lee Chong Wei is my favorite player; his resilience and fighting spirit never fail to inspire me.

### 🎮 Video Games & Board Games

I'm into all kinds of video games and German-style board games. Used to be a serious **Dota 2** player (still miss those late-night matches!). For board games, **A Feast for Odin** is my absolute favorite — nothing beats a good Viking strategy session.

### ✈️ Travel

I try to take a trip every year to explore new places and cultures. Whether it's hiking through mountains or wandering city streets, travel is my way of hitting the reset button.
